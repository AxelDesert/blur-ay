# blur-ay

Internet game, Wordle-like. A game where you got to find the movie poster blurred. In this game, the more tries you make, the less blurred the film poster becomes.
We use "The movie database" API. There are several themes such as : Horror, Action French, Comedy, Animation and ALL. You can put your score in a database at the end of a round.

Bash :
```
git clone git@github.com:AxelDesert/blur-ay.git
```

Then you open "src/principal_page.html"

Enjoy !
